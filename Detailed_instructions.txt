Before you begin make sure you have the docker desktop app and git running on your computer

1. Create a folder at some location where you can pull the docker codes from this repository. 
For example, let the folder name be "mpqMRI_docker" located in the "D:" drive.
2. Open powershell and navigate to "D:/"mpqMRI_docker" path. 
3. Run the following command there: 

git clone https://github.com/mariemgha/qCET.git

4. A folder called 'mpqMRI' will be created in the "mpqMRI_docker" folder. 
5. Navigate to 'mpqMRI_docker/mpqMRI/mpqMRI_Docker_v1/".
6. Build the docker image using the command :

docker build -t mpqmri .

7. Now, your docker image is built and you are ready to process data using docker. However, the data needs to be first prepared in the right format and saved in an "input folder".
8. For this, create an "input folder" with the data : The folder should contain six files named in this way (the files can be '.nii' or '.gz':
M0w_mag.nii
T1w_mag.nii
M0w_pha.nii
T1w_pha.nii
B1_1.nii
B1_2.nii

9. Run the docker using this command:

docker run -it --name mpqMRI -v "<path_to_your_input_folder>:/app/input" mpqmri python3 /app/script_run.py --input-folder /app/input

# NOTE: In the above command only give the path to the input folder in place of 'path_to_your_input_folder'. Rest of the command remains the same.#
